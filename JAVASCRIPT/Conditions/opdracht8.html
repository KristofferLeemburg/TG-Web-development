<!-- 
    
    Strict equality compares two values for equality. 
    Neither value is implicitly converted to some other value before being compared. 
    If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal. 
    If the values have the same type, are not numbers, and have the same value, they're considered equal. 
    Finally, if both values are numbers, they're considered equal if they're both not NaN and are the same value, 
    or if one is +0 and one is -0.
